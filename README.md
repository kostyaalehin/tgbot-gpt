This repository contains a Telegram bot with the following capabilities:

   1. Voice Message Recognition: The bot is capable of recognizing standard Telegram voice messages in the .oga format.
   2. Conversion to .mp3: It can convert the voice messages to the .mp3 format.
   3. OpenAI Speech-to-Text Functionality: Utilizing OpenAI's speech-to-text API, the bot can transform voice messages into text.
   4. Interaction with OpenAI Chat: It sends the extracted text to the OpenAI chat API, receives a response from ChatGPT, and maintains conversation context.
   5. Conversation Context Preservation: The bot is designed to preserve the context of the conversation for seamless interactions.

Additionally, the bot can also accept text input directly, send it to the OpenAI chat API, receive a response from ChatGPT, and maintain the conversation context.

It is worth noting that the bot is currently deployed on a local computer, but it has the potential to be deployed on a cloud server. However, this functionality has not been implemented at this stage.
